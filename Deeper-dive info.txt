1) In this we have created structure in a proper manner like divided folders into components ,containers, assets(for images and videos), cockpit
2) After react 16 functional based components can also manage state 
	a) Presentational Component-> this is the component that does not manage state. And it is prefer to have 				      presentational components in your project.

Note : Try to have state in containers only as u will know where is your state .

Learned about Lifecycle and UpdateLifecycle and also implemented that


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) useEffect
2)shouldComponentUpdate
3) COmponentDidUpdate
4) componentWillUnmount (when ever we have to do some clean up operation)
5) React.memo() (for optimization)( wrap functional component with this)
6) PureComponents (just like shouldComponentUpdate but in this case it checks for all properties of props)
7) Auxiliary (to create multiple elements in return statement)
8) React.Fragment (does exactly the same thing like aux component does
9) Higher order components
10) withClass
11) PropTypes Command-> npm install --save prop-types
12) Refs and useRef(for functional components)
13) Context
14) contextType and useContext()
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
q1) how can you send multiple elements(or JSX) without using div in return statement?
-> Creating functional component Auxiliary and then from there return props.children and thenwrap it around those multiple elements.
